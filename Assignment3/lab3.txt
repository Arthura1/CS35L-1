1. To get the file:
wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

To unzip file:
tar -xvf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

2. Read INSTALL file. To install file: 
cd coreutils-7.6/
Made new directory: mkdir new
Run:  ./configure --prefix="$PWD/new"
Run: make 
Run: make install 

3. 
export LC_ALL='en_US.UTF-8'
Bug can be seen by  ./ls -l bin/bash
Correct version:  ls -l
Difference in date format can be seen.

4. To fix bug: 
Went to the src folder in directory
Opened ls.c : emacs ls.c
Used Brady's patch to make following changes:
Noted the lines with - and + sign in brady's patch and
removed lines with - sign (case_long_iso_time_style:) and
added lines with + sign to ls.c


5.
Ran make again.
There were less commands executed this time because only ls.c 
was modified. Make enters directories and outputs 
"Nothing to be done for 'dir_name' "

6.
Ran make install
touched a few files
then ran: ./ls -l bin/bash
Gives correct date format.
