Q1:
Brady removed "case_long_iso_time_style:" because there was a
goto statement that went to this label. No, it was uneccessary 
to remove this line because the goto line was removed, thus that label
would never be referenced.

Q2:
This version of Coreutils might cause the following problems: 
- In countries where date is read in a different format, 
it might cause problems in comprehension.
- It would cause inconsistencies in other programs that display dates 
in different format.

Q3:
Command: ./randline.py -n 5 /dev/null
Output gives: "IndexError: list index out of range"
This is because the python script attempts to access elements of the file
using arguments in brackets. Since there are no elements at that 
index(or any index), we get this error. 

Q4:
Output:
File "./randline.py", line 65
    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

This is because python3 has a different error syntax. 
python2 had automatic tuple unpacking but in
python3 the tuple parameter unpacking was removed 
causing the error syntax to be different.
